# Stellar Fortress






## Game Structure:

(Does this work chinmay)
 - ### Home world (Starting area)
   - Player could choose basic planet stuff
     - Color and other more cosmetic things
     - Difficulty
       - Starting area could decide the minimum difficulty for all planets
   - Could act as a tutorial area
   - Allows you to get a start building a base and producing basic materials.
     - Probably low yield low rarity resources, just enough to build a basic base and get their first ship maybe.
- ### Planets
  - #### **Generation**
    - Planets type could be determined on world creation
    - The actual planet map could be generated on first visit
  - #### **Type**
    - Oxygen Level
      - Lower o2 levels could mean higher dificulty but better resources
        - Maybe: Its harder to survive/farm and special tech might be needed
        - Some resources like food or water would have to be imported
