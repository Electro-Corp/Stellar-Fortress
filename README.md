# Stellar Fortress
## folders
`src` is the game engine <br>
`game` contains the json files for the base game and a directory for mods 
<br>
BOTH ARE CRITICAL!

## Code Style

In general, we're not exhaustively strict about coding style, but there are some preferable guidelines to follow:

- `PascalCase` for classes, function names, and enumerations.
- `m_camelCase` for member variables.
- `g_camelCase` for global variables.
- `p_camelCase` for function parameters.
